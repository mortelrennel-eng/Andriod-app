Priority suggestions and missing features (actionable)

1) Enforce server-side role checks (HIGH)
- Implement custom claims for user roles via Admin SDK or Cloud Functions.
- Update Storage rules to check `request.auth.token.role`.
- Acceptance: Superadmin-only writes to storage and attendanceDay.

2) Improve DB model consistency (HIGH)
- Mirror students under `sections/{section}/students/{uid}` (done).
- Mirror attendance index per day: `attendance_by_day/{date}/{studentUid}` for fast queries.
- Acceptance: Queries for attendance per day are O(n_students_in_section) instead of scanning all attendance.

3) Migrate lists to RecyclerView + paging (MEDIUM)
- Replace ListView with RecyclerView + ListAdapter.
- Add search, sort, and pagination for large datasets.

4) Implement offline sync and queueing (MEDIUM)
- Use Room (or SQLite) to cache students/ebooks and queue attendance writes.
- Sync on reconnect; mark conflicted writes for manual review.

5) Attendance analytics & export (HIGH)
- Daily/weekly summaries, late counts, per-student reports.
- CSV export and scheduled email reports via Cloud Functions.

6) Admin UX improvements (LOW-MEDIUM)
- Bulk student operations, better error states, confirmation dialogs, activity indicators.

7) Tests & CI (HIGH)
- Add unit tests for data helpers and instrumented UI tests for key flows.
- Add GitHub Actions to run lint and build on PRs.

8) Security: rate-limiting & tamper detection
- Add Cloud Function that triggers on writes to attendance to verify plausibility and throttle suspicious activity.

9) Role management screen (LOW)
- SuperAdmin UI to promote/demote users and assign sections.

10) Documentation & README
- Add developer README, how to run locally, how to set up Firebase project, and deploy rules.

Pick which item you want me to implement next; I can start with code + tests for any of the HIGH priority items.
